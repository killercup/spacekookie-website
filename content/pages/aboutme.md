I'm a computer science student from Berlin, Germany. In my free time I make games, write free and open-source software and am an allround nerd.

I grew up in a small town in West Germany in the mid 90's. As a girl I loved technology, played around with electronics and copied bad BASIC game code from books. I wanted to become an inventor and designer.

Through my teenage years that changed. While I was still interested in technology, I got deeply into story writing, music and 3D modelling/ animation. All of that I wanted to one day put together and make games.

In my early 20's I started studying engineering, then later computer science. Though interested in chip design, my passion for video games had made me attempt to create one; and become obsessed with programming. I learned to code in Java, later in python, Ruby, C. I fell in love with free software and linux. Since then, I've tried to expand my knowledge on all things technology, trying not to loose touch too much with my artistic side.

I write too much C code, try to contribute to open source projects, try to make games. This blog is to be a journal of how projects are going, showcases of finished projects (yea right..."finished") and off-topic thoughts about whatever comes to mind.

I hope that you find any of this stuff even remotely useful. If so, yay! If you want to get in touch with me, the easiest way is probably my [twitter](https://twitter.com/spacekookie) or e-mail me at [kookie@spacekookie.de](mailto:kookie@spacekookie.de). You can find my GnuPG public key [here](/kookie.txt).

I also implement a 512mg Prime MTU according to the [RFC2549](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549).

My goal has always been to make things. Sometimes by myself, sometimes with others. I start many things that will never be done due to my own perfectionism. But some things might be worth highlighting. Things that could be useful to others. Or are still actively being developed for support. Or are just plain beautiful.

**Consider this my extended CV...**

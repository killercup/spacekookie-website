Welcome back to the Game of Codes, an introduction series to the LibGDX
framework. In the last post we started messing around with the inner
workings of LibGDX a bit more...

\*static\* \*voice cracking\* \*buzzing from speakers\*

"Hello? Can anyone hear me? I think I'm in space...Hello?"

Right...it's been about a year since I wrote on this series, a lot of
things have changed and I don't nearly have as much time anymore. BUT
people keep messaging me all over the place that they liked my LibGDX
series. SO...if you really do, I will continue it. Though, I'm slightly
out of ideas what to do. And I really have lost interest in continuing
that Star Chaser thing I started.

So....if you want to see something from me, post it on the comments
below, twitter at me, send me emails or smoke signals. If I get enough
feedback about this I will do it. If not, I'm sure there are better and
more up to date resources out there :)

So yea, would be cool to hear from you guys \<3

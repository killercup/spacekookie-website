# Fun memory violations

This is my website built with pelican (mostly) and a lot of HTML/CSS/JS hacks. Is this artsy enough yet?!

Dependencies are `pelican markdown webassets`

The pelican build.

Host with `pelican content` and `make devserver`
Default port is 8000.

Hosted on Github because...not really sure exactly. Maybe someone can learn something from it (ha...yea).

**This is the `develop` branch which is hosted on [beta.spacekookie.de](https://beta.spacekookie.de)**
